[description]
	I wrote clipodder to be a alternative to bashpodder, and gpo.
	Bashpodder tends to download too much extra "stuff" along with the podcast
	which is quite annoying. Gpo (from gpodder) has too many deps, 
	and uses a sql database backend.
	
	
[deps]
	python2
	python-feedparser [5.1] (On ubuntu use "easy_install feedparser", other systems may vary)
	pycurl (python-pycurl)

[notes]
	The config will be initially created the first time you run
	clipodder. The config file is located at "~/.clipodder/config".
	Clipodder's downloads are based of the files themselves, 
	so don't delete/rename any of them (until it has exceeded 
	the number of downloads_per_url for that podcast). 
	
	Example
	If downloads_per_url is set to 2, it will download the 
	first 2 podcasts from that feed. Eventually you will 
	have 3, 4, 5, etc... videos. If you have 5 downloaded you can 
	delete the oldest 3, and be good to go. 


	You can now download other media types aswell.
	Simply add "pdf", "html", etc... to the end of the url
	
	Urls need to be named in this type of fashon:

	1 = http://someurl.org/feed pdf html 
	2 = http://someurl.org/feed audio video
	foo = http://someurl.org/feed.xml <-- dot xml is ok
	bar = http://someurl.org/feed audio <-- only audio
	
	(It just needs to be unique or ConfigParser will 
	not pick up on it)


	[NEW] It will now print to the console in color (if enabled
	in the config file).
	
	[NEW] You can now add path=/directory/here and name=MyDownloadFolder. 
	Do not use spaces with name=

	Its best to add this to crontab, maybe sometime early in 
	the morning before you wake up.
