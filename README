[description]
	I wrote this to be a alternative to bashpodder, and gpo.
	Bashpodder downloads too much "crap" along with the podcast. 
	Gpo (from gpodder) has too many deps, and unlike clipodder uses a sql database.
	
	
[deps]
	python2
	python-feedparser
	pycurl (python-pycurl)

[notes]
	The config file is located at "~/.clipodder/config"
	clipodder's downloads are based of the files themselves, 
	so don't delete/rename any of them (until it has downloaded 
	the num of max_downloads for that podcast). Example
	if max_downloads is set to 2, it will download the 
	first 2 podcasts from that feed. Eventually you will 
	have 3, 4, 5 videos. If you have 5 downloaded you can 
	delete the first 3, and be good to go. 

	Urls need to be named in this type of fashon:
	1 = http://someurl.org/feed
	2 = http://someurl.org/feed
	something = http://someurl.org/feed
	unique = http://someurl.org/feed

	(It just needs to be unique or ConfigParser will 
	not pick up on it)
